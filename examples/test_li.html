<h2>Open source - Make at least 6 contributions in a year</h2>
<p>I love open source, it enables so much of the work I do. I write <a title="Java Script - based on ECMAScript an open standard" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">c</a><a title="Ruby - with ruby test an open standard with multiple implementations" href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">o</a><a title="Go - A single open source implementation from Google" href="http://golang.org/">d</a><a title="Scala - similar to go in that it has a single implementation" href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">e</a> in an open source language; the result will be served by an open source <a title="Apache web server" href="http://httpd.apache.org/">web</a> <a title="Nginx" href="http://nginx.org/en/">server</a>; and parsed and executed by an open source <a title="Gecko - Engine behind firefox " href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko">br</a><a title="Blink - Engine behind Chrome and Opera" href="http://www.chromium.org/blink">ows</a><a title="Webkit - Engine behind Safari" href="http://www.webkit.org/">er</a>. That is incredible and I am actively encouraged to help but for years I've done basically nothing.. unacceptable!</p>
<p>6 contributions, or one every two months was a reasonable target but has not come to fruition. <a title="Etsy's StatsD" href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd">StatsD</a> <a title="StatsD pull request accepted!" href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd/pull/327">accepted a change</a> to the go client (it didn't even build!) which was amazing but one in a year is still pretty rubbish.</p>
<p>My poor open source contributions is partly because at work - for the first of the half of the year - I was in a bit of a rut and working on a closed source platform doing things that the business had done before so rarely ran into issues. Although, that is a poor excuse; being a "9 to 5"-er has never been my goal although for most of this year that is all I have been.</li>
